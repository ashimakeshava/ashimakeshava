## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Looks like you've stumbled onto my GitHub profile. Let me hold you a little bit longer. :eyes:

### About Me
I am a Cognitive Science PhD student. I study vision in natural environments while interacting with the world. I've spent most of my PhD time understanding human behavior in virtual environments. My current research interests are `embodied cognition`, `human-machine interaction`, `intention recognition`, `neuro-ergonomics`

### Don't know what you're looking for?
Here's some of my projects that might interest you:

:point_right: [**Here**](https://github.com/ashimakeshava/neuro_datasci) is an online course I created for absolute beginners to get into neuro-based data science.

:point_right: [**Here**](https://github.com/ashimakeshava/ergovr_gaze_guidance) is my project repo for one of my PhD projects, where we investigate eye movements in VR while performing a novel natural task.

:point_right: [**Here**](https://github.com/ashimakeshava/gaze_tool_interaction) is my project repo for one of my PhD projects, where we investigate eye movements in VR while interacting with novel objects. Results out soon!

:point_right: [**Here**](https://github.com/ashimakeshava/VR_ET_comp) is my project repo where we compare performance of two different VR headsets using multiple tests. Results out soon!
