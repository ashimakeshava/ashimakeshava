### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You've found yourself on my GitHub profile.

I am a Cognitive Science PhD student. I study vision in natural environments while interacting with the world. I've spent most of my PhD time understanding human behavior in virtual environments. My current research interests are `embodied cognition`, `human-machine interaction`, `intention recognition`, `neuro-ergonomics`

Don't know what you're looking for? Here's some of my projects that might interest you:
